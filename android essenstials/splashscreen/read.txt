activity splash.xml should be in the layout sub folder found in the res folder
anim fade in .xml should be in the anim sub folder found in the res folder(if you dont have that folder you can create yours)

splash activity.java should be in the java folder.

modify your android manifest.xml file with this code

<activity
    android:name=".SplashActivity"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>


i assume that you have prior knowledge on how the files are supposed to be structed in the project
